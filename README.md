This is a HIGHLY-OPINIONATED set of `package.json` defaults I use for my open-source and closed-source work.

The following plugins are assumed:

@vue/eslint-config-prettier
eslint
eslint-plugin-vue
stylelint
stylelint-config-standard

The Vetur plugin is also assumed, with the HTML Formatter option set to NONE. I'd love to use js-beautfy-html, except for this issue:

https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/issues/1678

This is SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME. I don't really expect anyone else to use this, as it's highly subjective to my personal taste
in HTML, JS, and CSS formatting. I just did it because I got tired of having to copy and paste settings among all of my repos. But
if you get value from it, great!
